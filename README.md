# CoastlineGenerator
Small framework, made in a jupiter notebook.
Capable of creating a grid of cells around a Geometry. 
When we do it on hidrografic objects, we call it Coastline.

There are multiple ways to run a jupiter notebook, I will give you one.

4. Activate conda enviroment.

      conda activate CG
      
5. Install Jupyter Notebook

      conda install jupyter
      
6. Install necessary dependencies.

      pip install geopandas matplotlib
